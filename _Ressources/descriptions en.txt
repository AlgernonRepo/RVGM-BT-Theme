3DO

3DO is a company founded by former Electronic Arts CEO, Trip Hawkins. A partnership was signed with Panasonic, Sanyo and Goldstar, each capable of producing its own version of the machine, and the first 3DO was marketed in April 1993. On a slightly lower level than the Saturn and PS1 in 3D, it is able to play videos in full screen. Each paddle had its own additional port as a multitap.
But there has been too little interesting games made on this support.

AMIGA 1200

The Amiga 1200 (A1200) released in 1992 is the third-generation computer from Commodore. It incorporates a processor 68020 2 times more powerful clocked at 14 MHz supported by an AGA graphic chipset, 2 MB of RAM as standard, and the sound always on 4-way stereo 8Bit. The normal mode display changes to 256 colors and 262,144 colors in HAM-8 mode from a palette of 16,777,216. Two types of games appear, those simply adapted to use the AGA like Chaos Engine, and those that will get 100% off like the cult Payback, Guardian, Banshee, Alien Breed 3D & Pinball Illusions.

AMIGA 4000

The Amiga 4000, an expandable pro computer, was released in 1992. It was the last developed by Commodore before its bankruptcy in 1994. Still used in 1996, it could include, as in our Workbench configuration, a 68060 processor running at 50Mhz, a minimum of 512MB of RAM, a PowerPC 604e 233Mhz card and an RTG (Real Time Graphics) display for True Color 24-bit rendering in addition to the AGA chipset. A CD-ROM drive and IDE hard drives were also included. Our game set runs from 1996 to 2002.

AMIGA 500

The Amiga 500 (A500) is Commodore's first 16/32-bit entry-level computer. Released in 1987, it is in direct competition with the Atari 520 ST. The Amiga 500 uses a Motorola 68000 processor clocked at 7 MHz, 512 KB of RAM as standard, a Denise chip for display and a Paula chip to manage the sound on 4 channels (Chris Hülsbeck will manage to mount up to 8) . It can originate display in 320 × 256 pixels and 32 colors or 640 × 512 pixels and 16 colors, but in late 1989 with special modes they go up to 128 colors on the screen. Cult games will then see the day as Shadow of the Beast.

CD32

The Amiga CD32 is a fifth generation video game console marketed by Commodore in September 1993. It’s a console whose architecture is similar to the Amiga 1200 with a CD-ROM drive. It is the first 32-bit to be released in the West, FM Towns Marty having preceded it in Japan. Like the 3DO or Jaguar, marketed at the same time, the CD32 failed to break into the market in the face of PSX and Saturn. Due to its technical limitations, its bitmap display mode greatly limits it in the display of textured 3D games then in fashion. Part of the CDTV catalog is compatible with the console.

CDTV

Released in 1991 Amiga CDTV is a third generation console. Its architecture is based on the Amiga 500 with a 6800 to 7.16 Mhz processor, an ECS graphics chip, 1 MB of RAM and a CD-ROM drive. Comes with a joystick it was intended for a family audience neophyte in computer, interested in games but also by multimedia capabilities and interactivity. For example, the Grolier encyclopedia was one of its flagship products. It was a commercial failure and less than one hundred games were released on Amiga CDTV. A large part are reissues of Amiga 500 games.

AMSTRAD CPC

The Amstrad CPC (short for Color Personal Computer) is a series of 8-bit home computers produced by Amstrad between 1984 and 1990. It was designed to compete in the mid-1980’s home computer market, which was dominated by the C64 and the ZX Spectrum. The series spawned a total of six distinct models: The CPC464, CPC664, CPC 464plus and 6128plus. The CPC model’ hardware is based on the Zilog Z80A CPU, complemented with either 64 of 128kb of memory.

APPLE 2

The Apple II was one of the first personal computers in the world, manufactured on a large scale. It was designed by Steve Wozniak and marketed on June 10th, 1977 by Apple. The Apple II uses an 8-bit architecture, 4KB of RAM, a cassette player, and a 6 color 280x192 display with composite video output.  The Apple II operating system was contained in ROM along with Integer BASIC. VisiCalc, alone permitted the sale of many Apple II’s.

APPLE 2e

The Apple IIe [also called the Apple IIe] is the third model in the Apple II series, personal computers manufactured by Apple Computer and released in 1983. The e in the name stands for enhanced, referring to the fact that several popular features were now built-in that were only available as upgrades and add-ons in earlier models. It also added some new features, such as 64KB of RAM, a display change from 560x192 in monochrome to 280x192 in 6 col., & 140x192 in 16 colors.

APPLE 2 GS

The Apple IIgs is the fifth and most powerful model in the Apple II series of personal computers produced by Apple Computer and released September 15, 1986. The "GS" in the name stands for Graphics and Sound, referring to its enhanced multimedia capabilities. It uses an 16-bit architecture, 256KB RAM expandable to 8MB, a 3½ external floppy drive (800 KB) and allows display 640x200 in 6 colors or 320x200 in 256 colors with scart. They add an joystick port too.

ATARI 2600

The Atari 2600, originally called the Atari VCS, is a second-generation video game console produced by Atari between 1977 and 1991.  It comes with a pair of joysticks and a Combat game.  This is the third console to use cartridges and the most popular console of its generation.  The console’s game library consists of approximately 900 titles, original hits [Pitfall!] conversions of famous arcade games [Space Invaders] and the first licensed games [Raiders of the Lost Ark].

ATARI 5200

The Atari 5200 is a video game console released by Atari in 1982.  It was created to compete with consoles made by Coleco and Mattel, which at this time were the most powerful and cheapest on the market.  The Atari 5200 is essentially an Atari 400 without a keyboard.  The console had a revolutionary new joystick with an analog stick and function keys [start, stop, reset].  It also benefited from having other innovations, like 4 serial joystick ports and a storage drawer.

ATARI 7800

The Atari 7800 ProSystem, or simply Atari 7800, is a console made by the Atari Corporation in January 1986 in collaboration with GCC, who had some experience creating arcade games.  The 7800 competes with the Nintendo NES and Sega Master System.  It has the ability to display a huge amount of moving objects [75 to 100], which far exceeds previous consoles.  The Atari 7800 joysticks are simple, and backward compatible with the Atari 2600.

ATARI 800

The Atari 800 is part of the first range of computers manufactured by Atari, and was released in 1979.  In order to stand out from the crowd, Atari chose to innovate by proposing the first personal computer to have more than one custom processor to assist the classic 6502, to make things at the programming level a lot easier. Its old fashioned look, due to its resemblance to a typewriter, made it fit into the family environment perfectly.

ATARI Jaguar

The Jaguar is a cartridge-based home console (CD-Rom drive sold separately) from 1993, with a limited game library, which never became a great success.  It was the only 64-bit console of its time [the PlayStation and Saturn being 32 bit], causing a controversy, since its two 64-bit processors are nothing more than two graphics accelerators.  It has a 32-bit graphics processor and a 16-bit CPU.  It is the most recent console produce by Atari.

ATARI LYNX

The Atari Lynx is a 16-bit handheld game console released by Atari Corporation in 1989. The Lynx holds the distinction of being the world's first handheld electronic game with a color LCD. The system is also notable for its forward-looking features, advanced graphics, and ambidextrous layout.
In the same year Nintendo released the monochromatic Game Boy which out sold the Lynx.

ATARI ST 

The Atari ST platform marked the second half of the 1980s. Its success was as much general public (games), as professional (publication and MIDI music). The 520 ST, entry-level model, had a Motorola 68000 processor at 8 MHz, 512 KB of RAM, a Yamaha 3-way sound chipset and a 320x200 pixel display in 16 colors or 640x200 pixels in 4 colors among 512. ST Stands for Sixteen / Thirty-two and refers to the mixed 16/32 bit architecture of its CPU. It was also said to be the initials of Sam Tramiel, son of Jack Tramiel, president of Atari at the time.

C64
The Commodore 64 is a personal computer designed by the firm of Jack Tramiel in 1982. It remains the best-selling model of its decade with 13 million copies sold worldwide. It uses an 8-bit 6510 microprocessor and has 64 kilobytes of RAM. Its graphics chip, VIC-II, provides 16 colors and hardware scrolling and sprite capabilities. The sound chip, SID, has three voices, several waveforms, sound modulations and filtering capabilities. It is very advanced for its time. Its designer, Bob Yannes, will be the co-founder of the synthesizer company Ensoniq.

C128
Extended and compatible version of the Commodore 64 but revamped (look that would inspire the Amiga 500) with 128 KB of RAM. It was equipped with the C64 6510 processor to ensure 100% compatibility, but also with a new 8502 processor. It also contained a Zilog Z80 processor with the CP / M operating system. Finally, it proposed screen switching from standard 40 column mode to 80 column mode. Little sold and little supported by publishers, the Commodore 128 was the last 8-bit machine marketed by Commodore Business Machines, shortly before the release of the Amiga.

C20
The VIC-20 is an 8-bit personal computer designed by Commodore with 5 kb of RAM (including 3.5 kb for BASIC applications) and a central unit based on a MOS 6502 processor. It resembled its successors the C64 and the C16 . The VIC-20 appeared in June 1980, 2 years and 9 months after the release of Commodore's first personal computer, the PET. It was designed to better compete with the new Apple II as well as the Tandy TRS-80 and it sold a million copies. Due to its low memory and low-resolution display, it was used for educational or recreational purposes.

PET
Commodore launched in 1977 an integrated machine for personal use, under the name of Commodore PET 2001. This precursor computer is part of the famous '1977 Trinity' with the Apple II and the Tandy TRS-80. This Personal Electronic Transactor (or PET) was designed by Chuck Peddle as a monobloc box, incorporating keyboard, reduced screen and cassette player, the first microcomputer ready to operate as soon as it is connected. Current competitors like the Apple II and the TRS-80 required an external tape recorder.

C16Plus4
Released in 1984 to replace the VIC-20, the Commodore C116, C16 and Plus / 4 range targeted the entry-level market. A MOS7501 or 8501 processor succeeds the 6502 and is 75% faster. However only one TED co-processor is included for audio and video. Also unlike the C64, no hardware acceleration exists on these machines. The Plus / 4 has 32k of RAM and integrates four office applications into it. This project was a commercial failure in the USA and stopped in 1985 even if copies were sold in Europe and especially in the east, behind the iron curtain.
